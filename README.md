# WASP
## Intended purpose:
### Wireless Alert Signal propagator (WASP) is intended to solve the issue of communication between cyclers. Riding bicycles always have been dangerous. The obstacles on the road and sound may distract cyclers. The ambient often being loud that cyclers can hardly hear each other. This causes cyclers often do not recognize each otherâ€™s speech with a distance. WASP is intended to solve the issue. By sending different message types, cyclers can communicate with less errors. If the cycler behind fell, his/her node will send a broadcast to all cyclers nearby about the fall.
